        Bleach is a very good anime. It has many fillers that could be skipped. But there is a reason it is in big 3.
        The suspence,the entrences are just epic.It has some of the top notch fights and have too good BGM's. A must
        watch too.

        This was a very fun anime to watch.This was probably inspired by Harry Potter. This was funny and shows
        friendship. This anime is on a boy who is misfit
        for world. The world is where everyone has magic but our protagnist have only muscles(physical power).

            This anime is probably inspired by John Wick. First episode of this anime was one of the best first episode I watched of any anime. It had some of most epic fights I watched. Fights animation,powers and fighting style were some of the best.

            This anime is of a weak boy. Who is going back and forth into past and future to save his friends and future. In season 1 and 2 you might feel annoyed by how weak MC is but side characters make up for it. S3 is prtty good. Suggested to watch.
